Design Patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems
in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can
customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. It is
general concept for solving a particular problem.

What does pattern consist of ?
1. Intent: this briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
2. Motivation: this explains the problem and the solution the patterns makes possible.
3. Structure of classes shows each part of the patterns and how they interrelate.
4. Code example: this could be in any language, it just makes it easier to grasp the idea
behind the pattern.

Categories of Design Patterns
1. Creational patterns: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which
increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
a. Factory method.
b. Abstract method.
c. Builder.
d. Prototype.
e. Singleton.

2. Structural patterns: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger
structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
a. Adapter.
b. Bridge.
c. Composite.
d. Decorator.
e. Facade.
f. Flyweight.
g. Proxy.

3. Behavioural patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities
between objects.
a. Chain of responsibility.
b. Command.
c. Iterator.
d. Mediator.
e. Memento.
f. Observer.
g. State.
h. Strategy.
